I am a Developer and passionate about what I do.
I recently graduated as a Bachelors Degree in Software Developer from the institute KEA, Copenhagen, Denmark.
I have been living in Copenhagen for 4 years. I have knowledge on few of the modern web-dev tools and libraries i.e. React, Angular, Gatsby and other
JS frameworks. I am also familiar with stack tech such as MEAN and MERN stack and has used them in my various College's and personal projects.

In my leisure time I like to get together with my friends and go out have fun or just stay at home and have cozy time playing fifa and grabbing some snacks.
Playing football, basketball and ping-pong are the sports activities that I'd like to indulge once in a while whenever I get the chance.
